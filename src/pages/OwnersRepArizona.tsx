  {
    q: "How is an owner's rep for alternative building systems different from a general construction manager?",
    a: "A construction manager works inside the GC's organization or alongside it on a CMAR contract. An owner's rep works directly for the owner and is independent of the GC. On alternative-system projects, the difference is more important. A GC quoting a system they have not built before tends to load the bid with contingency. An independent owner's rep with system experience can compress that contingency by writing a tighter spec and bringing in subs who know the system. The owner ends up with a better number and a builder who is set up to deliver it.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does Arizona require special licensing to use SABS or other alternative systems?",
    a: "No special licensing is required for the systems themselves. The standard contractor licensing in Arizona (B-2 Residential, KA Dual Building, and similar) covers alternative-system construction. What matters is the installer crew's experience and the rep's ability to navigate the inspector relationship. The work is in execution, not in licensing paperwork.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use a conventional architect on a SABS project?",
    a: "Yes, with caveats. A conventional architect can absolutely design a SABS project. The drawings will need a wall section detail and structural notes that reference SABS specifically rather than ICF or CMU. The structural engineer is the more critical pick. The system has documented structural performance, but the engineer needs to be willing to stamp drawings that reference ICC-ES ESR-1638 rather than retreating to a familiar wall type.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I evaluate whether an alternative building system is right for my project?",
    a: "Three filters. First, fire and insurance posture. If the project is in a wildfire-exposed market or the insurance carrier has already flagged it, the alt-system case is much stronger. Second, schedule. If the program needs to compress trade time on site, SABS reduces trade count meaningfully. Third, life-cycle math. Alternative systems usually price higher on materials and lower on total project cost once HVAC sizing, schedule, and insurance are factored.",

          An owner's representative for alternative building systems in Arizona is a project lead who manages design, permitting, procurement, and construction on behalf of the owner, specifically when the project uses a non-conventional structural system like SABS, ICCF, SCIP, or SIPs. The role exists because alternative systems require a different specification path, a different inspector conversation, and a different trade lineup than stick-frame or block.

          I do this work in Phoenix, Scottsdale, Pahrump, and across the state. Most owners hiring an owner's rep have run conventional builds before. The first time they specify SABS or another alternative system, they discover their existing rep does not know what to do with the submittal package, the inspector has never approved one, and the GC's number is fifty percent above what the project actually costs. That gap is the reason this role exists separately.

          This is a known role with thirty years of trade press behind it. The Construction Management Association of America (CMAA) publishes standard scope documents. Most reps have a wheelhouse of three or four building types they have done many times.

          LÏEF leads with SABS because the math at the project level is the strongest in the category for Arizona conditions. We will rep on any of the others where it is the right system for the program. The job is to put the owner in the building they are paying for, not to sell them a system.
