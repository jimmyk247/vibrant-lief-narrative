          An owner's rep for SABS construction in Arizona runs a defined chain of relationships on every project: the architect of record, the engineer of record stamping the structural drawings against ICC-ES ESR-1638, the authority having jurisdiction reviewing the alternate-materials path, the GC carrying the panel-set installer crew, and the finance partner underwriting against the system's longer payback and stronger insurance posture. LÏEF Development is the Arizona owner's rep that has run this chain end-to-end on multiple delivered and in-flight projects. The pages below are the project file.

          Most "owner's rep for alternative systems" content on the web is a brochure paragraph and a stock photo. There is no operator chronicle. That is the gap this page fills. If you are an owner evaluating whether to run a SABS project, you need to see the chain. If you are a GC bidding alongside us, you need to see the trade lineup. If you are a lender or insurance carrier seeing your first SABS file, the named precedent matters more than the brochure. I run this work. Below is the case file.

          Four projects, three jurisdictions, two states, one delivery chain. The point of publishing the file is that "owner's rep for alternative building systems in Arizona" is not a category of one in the abstract. It is a category of one with a named operator, a known engineer-of-record relationship, an active AHJ orientation playbook, and a finance and insurance file you can show a lender.
